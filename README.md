**Welcome to the Domain of my Banking App**

This project explores the power of hexagonal architecture (aka ports and adapters) in Go (Golang) for crafting clean, maintainable banking applications. Think of it like a sorcerer meticulously channeling their cursed energy:  modular components and well-defined interfaces ensure flexibility and adaptability.  With this structure, the core domain logic is protected, insulated from external volatility like a barrier technique.  Just as a skilled Jujutsu sorcerer adapts to any opponent, this application is prepared to evolve with changing requirements or integrate with new technologies.
